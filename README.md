Hi i'm Mauz and this is my game RannyRun.
RannyRun is a 2D rogue-style arcade project built in Unity. 
It features randomized weapon and passive skill selection, character skin management, career progression tracking, and a PowerUp shop interface. 
Gameplay includes dynamic menus, unlockable upgrades, responsive UI elements, and character animations integrated throughout multiple scenes (Start, Main Menu, PowerUp, Gameplay). 
All logic, state persistence, and interface behavior are fully managed via custom C# scripts and PlayerPrefs.
Up to now, it is only available on Android. You can find the download in the "RannyRunAPK" branch.
